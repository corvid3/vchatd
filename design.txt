# vchatd chat server | internal design

vchatd is internally split up into multiple components,
	each performing a different duty

a list of the components are listed below, alongside their related files
	- initializer 
		main.c
	- argument parser
		args.c
		args.h
	- config handler
		config.c
		config.h
	- acceptor
		acceptor.c
		acceptor.h
	- boss
		boss.c
		boss.h
	- connection workers
		worker.c
		worker.h
	- logic workers
		wlogic.c
		wlogic.h

descriptions of each components are to be found below

# the initializer
the initializer handles the starting and termination
	of the vchatd daemon
most of the init/term logic are found in the minimal main.c file

# argument parser
the argument parser is a simple argc/argv parser using basic POSIX functions
the initializer calls the argument parser, gets the results, and forwards
	any information to the config handler

# config handler
the config handler takes in information from the system or any arguments
	given to the daemon, and parses a .toml config file
the resulting parsed config file is translated into a struct and
	passed around the program as a const* global

# acceptor
running in it's own thread, the acceptor sets up a listened TCP port
	on a certain address and port (as described in the global config struct)
	and takes in any incoming connections
incoming connections are forwarded to the boss/message manager.

# connection workers
the connection workers handle all of the in/out data of client socket streams
a fixed amount of workers are spun up at the start of the daemon,
	and new connections are evenly spread out to the workers
a worker can hold MAX_CONS/MAX_WORKERS number of connections
when a full message is successfully received from the
